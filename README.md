# 🧠 BrainDump

Welcome to **BrainDump** — where chaos gets a UI.

This is not your average productivity app. It’s a digital dumping ground for every random shower thought, weird 3AM idea, half-written startup plan, or that one task you’ll probably still ignore.

Built to look cool on my portfolio and secretly be my personal note-taking app in disguise.  
No, I’m not releasing it publicly. Yes, it’s still better than most apps on your phone.  
No one asked for this. I made it anyway. 🫡

## 🧪 Tech Stack

- ⚡️ [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (because Create React App is ✝️)
- ⚛️ [React](https://react.dev/)
- 🔀 [React Router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/) (multi-page vibes but SPA life)
- 🎨 TailwindCSS (if it looks decent, thank this)
- 💾 LocalStorage (for now — Supabase will join the party later)

## 🧠 Sections

- `/` – Landing page. Basic intro. Big button. Minimal effort.
- `/thoughts` – Where ideas are born. Aka mental diarrhea dump zone.
- `/ideas` – More structured chaos. Upgrade your thoughts if they survived 48hrs.
- `/tasks` – Things you need to do but probably won’t.

If it breaks, blame Vite. Or React. Or the weather.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This app is a very serious productivity tool built with tears, memes, and caffeine.
Any resemblance to a polished, scalable product is purely accidental.
I may or may not continue working on it depending on mood, weather, and food availability.
GitHub is public but attention is private. Don’t stalk.
Also, if you found this impressive, I’m flattered. If not… your opinion is invalid.
